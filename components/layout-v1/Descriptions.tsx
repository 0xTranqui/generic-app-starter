        "Public Assembly and Private Destruction represent opposite ends of a codependant, creative cycle.",
        "To build the future we must eliminate any doubt that it's even possible to rebuild it in the first place. This means destroying many of the values that we’ve been taught to live by. Private destruction is a necessary evil. We need to let go of our comfortability in the present. We need to lean into our fear and relinquish the belief that the future will just work itself out. Reframing our mindset and acknowledging the dismal state of things is scary and painful, but also vital to contributing without restraint.",
        "Unfortunately, the overwhelming positivity that Public Assembly exudes does not capture the full story. Common representations of good intention can default to boring or bland. The darkest parts of the creative process can be the most relatable. Emphasizing our shared vulnerability dismantles the idea that involvement or support is only available to those that are in the know. Cultural impact through fashion and art transcends the general perception of Public Assembly. It’s the most powerful way to draw people in because you don’t need to care about crypto to relate to something on an emotional level.",
        "Private Destruction does not mean that everything has to be depressing. Destruction can also look like a compartmentalization of the process, the same way that assembly can. Producing the highest quality output, accessible to as many people as possible will always be the goal."
