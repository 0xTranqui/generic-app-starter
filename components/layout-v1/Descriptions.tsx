        "Public Assembly and Private Destruction represent a cycle of improving what has been created for the sake of building an alternative to traditional society.",
        "But to build the future we must first eliminate any doubt that it’s even possible. This means destroying most of the societal values that we’ve been taught to live by. Private destruction is a necessary evil. We need to let go of our comfortability in the present. We need to lean into our fear and let go of the belief that the future will just work itself out. Reframing our mindset and acknowledging the dismal state of things is scary and painful but also vital to contribute without restraint.",
        "Unfortunately, the overwhelming positivity that Public Assembly exudes does not capture the full picture. Common representations of good intention can default to boring or bland. The darkest parts of the creative process can be the most relatable. Emphasizing our shared vulnerability dismantles the idea that involvement or support is only available to those “in the know”. Cultural impact through fashion and art transcends the general perception of Public Assembly. It’s the most powerful way to draw people in because you don’t need to care about crypto to relate to something on an emotional level.",
        "Somebody buying our merch just because it looks cool is still supporting our initiative. Passive support still helps build our influence. Private Destruction does not mean that everything has to be depressing. Destruction can also look like a compartmentalization of the process, the same way that assembly can."
