        "Public Assembly and Private Destruction represent opposite ends of a codependent creative cycle. Before contributing to a larger ecosystem in a meaningful way, one must overcome the common psychological hurdles that obstruct true collaboration and innovative thinking. These obstructions often manifest as fear of the unknown, doubt in one's own capability, and a reservation towards fully trusting other collaborators. On a grander scale, the primary obstruction of meaningful contribution is the underlying worry that the future is not a truly modifiable thing.",
        "Private Destruction represents a necessary evil. We need to let go of our comfortability in the present. We need to lean into our fear and relinquish the belief that the future will just work itself out. Reframing our mindset and acknowledging our responsibility is scary and painful but also vital to contributing without restraint.",
        "The overwhelming positivity that Public Assembly exudes does not capture the full story of our grandiose mission. Common representations of good intention can default to boring or bland, leaving out the humanity that’s naturally embedded in our process. The darkest parts of working as a creative are often the most accessible. Emphasizing our shared vulnerability helps dismantle the idea that involvement is only available to those that are in the know. We encourage participation by framing the messaging in a way that doesn’t require a strong technical understanding to invoke support. A cultural impact through fashion and art could transcend the general perception of Public Assembly, especially if that relatable sense of human imperfection is communicated in a refreshing way.",
        "It’s important to note that the goal of Private Destruction is not to have everything be framed as depressing or negative. Destruction can also look like a compartmentalization of the process, the same way that assembly can. These darker themes are best communicated through humor, dialogue, music, and loud visual art. Producing the highest quality output, accessible to as many people as possible will always be the goal."
